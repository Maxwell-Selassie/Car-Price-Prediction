"""Preprocessing pipeline for feature selection, encoding, and scaling.

This module orchestrates the feature selection, encoding, and scaling steps
of the preprocessing pipeline using the respective classes defined in their respective files.
Workflow:
1. Import necessary libraries.
2. Define a PreprocessingPipeline class to manage the workflow.
3. Initialize FeatureSelector, FeatureEncoder, and FeatureScaler classes.
4. Define a process method to execute the preprocessing steps sequentially."""
